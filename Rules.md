# 🎲 Zilch: Serendipity Creak Edition

**Objective:** Be the player with the highest score over **10,000 points** after the final round is triggered.

---

## 🛠 Turn Structure

1. **The Roll:** On your turn, roll 6 dice.

2. **Scoring Requirement:** After every roll, you must set aside at least one scoring die or set.

3. **Zilch:** If a roll contains no scoring dice, you "Zilch," and all points accumulated during that turn are lost.

4. **Decision Phase:** After setting aside scoring dice, you may choose to:
   - **Bank:** Add your current turn total to your game score and end your turn.
   - **Roll:** Roll the remaining non-scoring dice to increase your turn total.

5. **Hot Dice:** If all 6 dice have scored (either in a single roll or accumulated), you may roll all 6 dice again to continue increasing your turn total.

## 🤝 The Inheritance Rule (Passing)

When a player chooses to **Bank**, their turn total and the remaining non-scoring dice are passed to the next player. 

The next player may choose:
- **Fresh Start:** Start a new turn with 6 dice and 0 points.
- **Inherit:** Start their turn with the previous player's banked points already in their running total, rolling only the remaining dice.

**Risk:** If the inheriting player Zilches, they lose those inherited points and their turn ends immediately.
