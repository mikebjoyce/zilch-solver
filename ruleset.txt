ZILCH: SERENDIPITY CREAK EDITION - OFFICIAL RULES
================================================================================

1. OBJECTIVE
   The goal is to be the player with the highest score over 10,000 points 
   after the final round is triggered.

2. TURN STRUCTURE
   - On a player's turn, they roll 6 dice.
   - After every roll, the player MUST set aside at least one scoring die/set.
   - If a roll contains no scoring dice, the player "Zilches," losing all 
     accumulated points for that turn.
   - If a player sets aside scoring dice, they may:
     a) Bank: Add turn total to their game score and end their turn.
     b) Roll: Roll the remaining (non-scoring) dice to increase the turn total.
   - Hot Dice: If all 6 dice have scored (either in one roll or accumulated), 
     the player may roll all 6 dice again to continue their turn total.

3. THE INHERITANCE RULE (PASSING)
   - When a player Banks their score, the turn total and the remaining 
     non-scoring dice are passed to the next player.
   - The next player can choose to:
     a) Start a fresh turn with 6 dice and 0 accumulated points.
     b) Inherit: Start their turn with the previous player's banked points 
        already in their running total, rolling only the remaining dice.
   - If the inheriting player Zilches, they lose the inherited points and 
     their turn ends.

4. SCORING TABLE (SINGLE ROLL ONLY)
   Points are calculated based ONLY on the dice currently being rolled. 
   Dice already set aside do not combine with new dice to form sets.

   SINGLE DICE:
   - One [1] = 100 points
   - One [5] = 50 points

   SETS (3x, 4x, 5x, 6x):
   Number | 3-of-a-kind | 4-of-a-kind | 5-of-a-kind | 6-of-a-kind
   -------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------
   [1]s   | 1000        | 2000        | 4000        | 8000
   [2]s   | 200         | 400         | 800         | 1600
   [3]s   | 300         | 600         | 1200        | 2400
   [4]s   | 400         | 800         | 1600        | 3200
   [5]s   | 500         | 1000        | 2000        | 4000
   [6]s   | 600         | 1200        | 2400        | 4800

   SPECIAL COMBINATIONS:
   - Small Straight [1,2,3,4,5] = 750 points (5 dice)
   - Large Straight [2,3,4,5,6] = 750 points (5 dice)
   - Full Straight  [1,2,3,4,5,6] = 1500 points (6 dice)
   - Three Pair (e.g., 1-1, 2-2, 3-3) = 1500 points (6 dice)

5. WINNING THE GAME
   - Once a player reaches 10,000 points or more, the "Final Round" is triggered.
   - Every other player gets exactly one more turn.
   - The player with the highest score at the end of this round wins.
